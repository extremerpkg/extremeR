\item{n.sims}{how many samples of simulated data would you like?;}

\item{n}{how large (sample size) should each sample be?;}

\item{pi.hat.naive}{what should be the fraction of cases in the sample?;}

\item{p}{how many normally-distributed covariates should the DGP have?;}

\item{X_corr}{what should be the average correlation among these covariates?;}

\item{pi}{what is the population-level probability of sampling a case?}

\item{Moran.I.corr}{what degree of global spatial autocorrelation (Moran I) should the underlying DGP have?;}

\item{spatial_structure}{on which map should the data be simulated ? (scotland_lipcancer, pennsylvania_lungcancer, and newyork_leukemia)}

\description{
Function to simulate data from a relevant data generating process (DGP) ;
currently this function supports the creation of DGPs with 1 layer of area effects (i.e. small-area effects)
}
